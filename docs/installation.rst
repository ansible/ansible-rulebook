============
Installation
============

You can install ``ansible-rulebook`` CLI through:

* :ref:`container_image`
* :ref:`pip_install`


.. _container_image:

Pulling the container image
===========================

The ``ansible-rulebook`` CLI is available as a container image.
You can pull the latest image from the `quay.io <https://quay.io/repository/ansible/ansible-rulebook>`_ registry:

.. code-block:: shell

    podman pull quay.io/ansible/ansible-rulebook:latest

.. _pip_install:

Installing with ``pip``
=======================

These instructions guide you through installing the ``ansible-rulebook`` CLI on your local system.
Ensure you have installed all components listed in the :ref:`requirements` section before starting the installation process.

.. _requirements:

Requirements
------------

* Python >= 3.9
* Python 3 pip

* Java development kit >= 17

  * Fedora: java-17-openjdk
  * Ubuntu: openjdk-17-jdk


Installation with pip
---------------------


1. Ensure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set if you have multiple Java installations. On Fedora-like systems it should be::

    JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre-17-openjdk


2. Install ``ansible-rulebook`` and dependencies via ``pip``::

    pip install ansible-rulebook ansible ansible-runner

.. note::

    By default, ``ansible-rulebook`` installs the `psycopg-binary` package, which is a PostgreSQL database adapter precompiled for the most common platforms.
    For production environments, we recommend that you install the `psycopg` package instead, which requires the PostgreSQL development headers to be installed on the system::

        pip install ansible-rulebook[production]

    See `psycopg installation instructions <https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/basic/install.html#local-installation>`_ for more information.


.. note::

    ``ansible-rulebook`` relies on the `jpy` Python package to communicate with the Java runtime. This package provide wheels for the most common platforms,
    `but not for all <https://github.com/jpy-consortium/jpy#automated-builds>`_. If you are using a platform that is not supported by `jpy` wheels, you will need to compile it by yourself.

    Refer to the `Compiling jpy section <#compiling-jpy>`_ for more information.


3. Install the ``ansible.eda`` collection which comes with various event source plugins and filters to get you started. See the instructions in the
`collection repository <https://github.com/ansible/event-driven-ansible#install>`_.


Installation examples
---------------------

On Fedora-like systems:

.. code-block:: shell

    dnf --assumeyes install java-17-openjdk python3-pip
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre-17-openjdk
    pip3 install ansible ansible-rulebook ansible-runner

On Ubuntu systems:

.. code-block:: shell

    apt-get --assume-yes install openjdk-17-jdk python3-pip
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
    export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
    pip3 install ansible ansible-rulebook ansible-runner


Compiling jpy
---------------------

To compile `jpy` from source at installation time, you will need to install the following additional dependencies:

* maven
* gcc
* python-devel package
    * Fedora: python3-devel
    * Ubuntu: python3-dev
* Environment variable `JAVA_HOME` set to the path of your Java installation

Then, you can run:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install ansible-rulebook --no-binary jpy


See the `jpy project <https://github.com/jpy-consortium/jpy>`_ for more information.
