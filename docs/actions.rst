          ruleset: Test rules4
          event:
            data: "{{events.third}}"


| The events and facts prefixes have rule scope and cannot be accessed outside of
| rules. Please note the use of Jinja substitution when accessing the event results.

      action:
        set_fact:
          fact:
            myfact: "{{event.i}}"

| A rulebook can have multiple rule sets, the set_fact/retract_fact/post_event allow you
| to target different rule sets within the rulebook. You currently cannot assert an event to
| multiple rule sets, it can be asserted to a single rule set. The default being the current
| rule set. Please note the use of Jinja substitution in the above examples  when accessing
| the event results in an action.

retract_fact

     - If the event is a deeply nested dictionary, the var_root can specify the key name whose value should replace the matching event value. The var_root can take a dictionary to account for data when we have multiple matching events.
     - No

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    action:
      print_event:

shutdown

     - Kind of shutdown can be either **graceful** or **now**. default is graceful.
     - No

| Generate a shutdown event which will terminate the ansible-rulebook process.
| If there are multiple rule-sets running in your rule book, issuing a shutdown will cause
| all other rule-sets to end, care needs to be taken to account for running playbooks which
| can be impacted when one of the rule set decides to shutdown. A shutdown message is
| broadcast to all running rule-sets.

Example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       name: shutdown after 5 events
       condition: event.i >= 5
       action:
          shutdown:
            delay: 0.125
            message: Shutting down after 5 events

Results
*******

When a rule's condition(s) are satisfied we get the results back as:
  * events/facts for multiple conditions
  * event/fact if a single condition

| This data is made available to your playbook as extra_vars when its invoked.
| In all the examples below you would see that facts/fact is an exact copy of events/event respectively
| and you can use either one of them in your playbook.

debug
*****
.. list-table:: debug ansible-rulebook
   :widths: 25 150 10
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Description
     - Required
   * - msg
     - A simple string or an array of strings, which can have references to event or events
     - No
   * - var
     - The variable to print, which can have references to event or events. Using {{ }} is optional.
     - No

| The debug action tries to mimic the debug command in ansible.
| If no arguments are provided it prints the matching events along with other important properties
| **msg** and **var** are mutually exclusive, you can have only 1 of them in the debug
| msg can be a single string or an array of strings, with references to event or events.
| With var using the Jinja style braces is optional like shown in the example below

Example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       name: debug with single message
       condition: event.i >= 5
       action:
          debug:
            msg: Simple debug message


    .. code-block:: yaml

       name: debug with multiple messages
       condition: event.i >= 5
       action:
          debug:
            msg: 
               - "Message 1 {{ event }}"
               - Second Message

    .. code-block:: yaml

       name: debug with var

  No arguments needed
